[Moved to the Citizens Advice organisation.](https://github.com/citizensadvice/find-your-local-citizens-advice-frontend-prototype)

# README

This app depends on [the API prototype](https://github.com/dxw/find-your-local-citizens-advice-api-prototype) to be running locally on port 3001.

As a prototype this is designed to be thrown away rather than used in production.

## Get started

```
bundle
bin/rails s
```

## Use it

<http://localhost:3000/offices>

There are a couple of query params that help demonstrate different search behaviour:

```
?limit=5
?eligible_only=true|false
```
